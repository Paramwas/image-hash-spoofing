# Image Metadata Hash Spoofing Tool

This standalone tool, packaged with `PyInstaller`, allows you to modify the metadata of an image file and generate a hash that matches a specified target hash prefix. The tool works by iterating over the metadata, adding incremental changes, and checking the resulting hash until a match is found.

## üìã Prerequisites

To run this tool, you'll need the following:

- **Python** (for packaging the script using `PyInstaller`)
- **PyInstaller** (for creating the standalone executable)
- **Pillow** (Python library for image manipulation)
- **hashlib** (Python library for hashing functionality)

You can install the necessary dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
pip install Pillow pyinstaller
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Overview

The tool works by running the `spoof.py` script, which performs the following actions:

### `calculate_hash(file_path, hash_algorithm="sha512")`

- Calculates the hash of a file using the specified hash algorithm (default is `sha512`).
- Reads the file in chunks and returns the hexadecimal hash of the file.

### `add_metadata(image_path, output_path, metadata)`

- Adds metadata to an image file, saving it in PNG format (converts to PNG if necessary).
- Uses the `PngInfo` object from the Pillow library to embed metadata into the image.

### `modify_image_to_match_hash(target_prefix, original_path, altered_path, hash_algorithm="sha512")`

- Modifies the metadata of an image iteratively until the hash matches the specified target hash prefix.
- Adds incremental metadata changes and checks the hash after each modification.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

After packaging the script with `PyInstaller`, you can run the tool as a standalone executable. The usage is as follows:

```bash
.\spoof.exe <hexstring> <original_image> <altered_image>
```

### Arguments:

- `<hexstring>`: The target hash prefix you want to match. It should be a hexadecimal string, and the tool will attempt to find a hash that starts with this prefix.
- `<original_image>`: The path to the original image file you want to modify.
- `<altered_image>`: The path where the modified image will be saved.

### Example:

```bash
.\spoof.exe 0x24 profile.jpg altered.jpg
```

In this example, the tool will modify the image `profile.jpg` by adding metadata, iterating over the changes until it generates an image whose hash starts with `0x24`. The resulting image will be saved as `altered.jpg`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Add to Environment Variable

Update the `PATH`:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press Enter.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab and click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **System Variables**, find and select the variable named **Path**, then click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and add the path to the directory containing `spoof.exe`.

Then, open PowerShell and run:

```bash
spoof 0x24 original.jpg altered.jpg
```

## üìú Notes

- The tool is packaged as a standalone executable, so you do not need Python or additional dependencies installed on the target machine.
- The tool is designed to work with PNG images. If the input image is not in PNG format, it will be automatically converted.
- The tool will continue to modify the image's metadata until it matches the specified hash prefix.
- The default hash algorithm is `sha512`, but you can change it by modifying the script.

## üìù Script Overview (`spoof.py`)

The script has the following core functions:

### `calculate_hash(file_path, hash_algorithm="sha512")`

This function calculates the hash of a file using the specified hash algorithm (default is `sha512`). It reads the file in chunks and returns the hexadecimal hash of the file.

### `add_metadata(image_path, output_path, metadata)`

This function adds metadata to an image file. It opens the image, adds the provided metadata, and saves the image in PNG format (converting to PNG if necessary). The metadata is added to the image using the `PngInfo` object from the Pillow library.

### `modify_image_to_match_hash(target_prefix, original_path, altered_path, hash_algorithm="sha512")`

This function iterates over the metadata and adds incremental changes until the hash of the altered image matches the specified target prefix. It calls `add_metadata` to alter the image and checks if the hash of the modified image matches the desired hash prefix. The script will continue this process, incrementing the metadata and attempting to match the hash until a match is found.

## üöÄ Usage

To run the script, use the following command format:

```bash
python spoof.py <hexstring> <original_image> <altered_image>
```

This will modify the image file as described and attempt to match the hash with the specified prefix.
